# AI for the Arts and Humanities Portfolio

### Repository Purpose
This repository documents my journey in the AI for the Arts and Humanities course, focusing on learning to read and interpret Python code, explore AI-assisted programming, and critically engage with machine learning concepts. It includes coding exercises, data analysis tasks, reflections on AI ethics, and a creative AI application design. The goal is to bridge technology and the humanities, showcasing how AI can enhance engagement, learning, and inclusion.
### Key Learning Outcomes
1. Understand Python for AI & Humanities
   - Learn to read and interpret Python code rather than writing it from scratch.  
   - Use GitHub Codespaces and Jupyter Notebook for AI-related tasks.  

2. Work with AI-Assisted Coding & Data Processing
   - Use Microsoft Copilot to enhance coding skills.  
   - Process text, images, and audio in Python.  

3. Explore Basic Machine Learning Concepts 
   - Work with Scikit-learn datasets and Pandas for data analysis.  
   - Understand machine learning workflows in a humanities context.  

4. Critically Engage with AI & Ethics 
   - Reflect on bias, transparency, and ethical issues in AI.  
   - Explore the cultural and social impact of AI applications.  

5. Design a Creative AI Application
   - Propose a conceptual AI project using Large Language Models (LLMs).  
   - Showcase how AI can enhance learning, engagement, or inclusion.
